        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>Since I was first introduced to computers when I was 12, I have always been learning my way around them. By 17, I obtained my CompTIA A+ certification in hardware and software. After I graduated high school, I served in the military and worked on avionics systems on jets. Once I finished my service in the military, I started learning programming and have been at it ever since.</p>

        <p>I already have experience with backend development and figured why don&#39;t I also get my front end experience to be well-rounded.</p>

        <p>I love to learn new things, especially in the computer science field. I completed the Treehouse Python Web Development Techdegree in 2016 and I am going on to complete some more techdegrees.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I just want to keep learning, making new/great things, and meet awesome peers along the way.</p>

        <p>Here are a few skills I hope to learn while I am in Front End Web Development:</p>

        <ul class="skills">
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Angular</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
